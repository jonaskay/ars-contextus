This placeholder post will cover the core loop of agentic work: understand intent, decompose tasks, execute changes, and validate outcomes. It will include examples of how engineers can pair with agents for refactors, test authoring, and documentation updates.

## Outline

- Why agentic workflows work in practice
- Task decomposition and safety checks
- Keeping changes small and reviewable
- Measuring impact with lightweight verification
